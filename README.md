# Outbreaks

This repository currently holds preliminary exploratory data analysis of CDC Reportable Outbreaks data from 2008-2020 -> for future project use (maybe)

Also contained here is some scribbly work I did for a case study in my Outbreak Investigations course. I might (remember to) add the full investigations at a later date
